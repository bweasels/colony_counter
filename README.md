# colony_counter
This program quantifies the colones grown in a 3D agar matrix. 
The program outputs both the number of colonies in each image as well as its cross sectional area in a .csv

The code automatically recurses through folders, so place the program in the highest directory with the images and run it.

The program also outputs QC images which highlight the colonies the detection algorithm finds.
These images are stored in a QC folder within each image folder.
